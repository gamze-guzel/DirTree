## Directory Tree Generator

A Directory Tree Generator lets you visualize the relationship between files and directories, thereby making it easier to understand the positioning of files and directories.
For this project, you can use os library to list the files and directories within a specific directory.

The `test` directory is available for you.

`dtg` should print the list of the files inside the test directory.


Your solution should something like this:

```
$ dtg
one.py
two.py
bar2.py
foo
baz.py
bar.py
```

and for 50 extra points, make it do this:

```
$ dtg
test/one.py
test/two.py
test/bar2.py
test/foo
test/foo/baz.py
test/foo/bar.py
```

see the difference??
